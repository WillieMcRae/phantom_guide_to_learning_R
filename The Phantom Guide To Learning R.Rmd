This is a book about learning the programming language of R. It is written in R Markdown in 2016 and hosted here on github during development.

It is written for those with little or no R experience and is designed to be a companion volume to more structured and dense texts that have been written by people who really **do** know lots of things about R.

Here I store my thoughts and reviews on the many books, courses and events out there designed to help the student, and I will give my opinions of the relative usefelness of each that I have tried.

I am not a programmer, or a statistician, or a data scientist. I do not hold formal qualifications in computer science (or any science). However, I attempt to practice a scientific mindset, and many (in fact most) of my intellectual and philosophical heroes did not possess any of the qualifications I mentioned either - so I don't care.

This is my completely biased, subjective attempt to make some sense of the learning path I have been on, specifically regarding the language of R.

If this book inspires you and keeps you moving, then it has done the job intended.

Good luck!

# 1. Reasons for learning R

For me, these were...

- learn how to improve what I was already doing for my day job (analyzing data as part of a decision making process)
- learn how to do some sort of programming, as a potential gateway drug into making computer games in the future, and as an insurance policy to become at least partly relevant for the age when the robots take over
- join a community of people who are learning and interested in making the world a better place
- learn skills of *craft*, how to actually *do* things, not just read, react and regurgitate information

# 2. Online

There are many online courses and videos for the student of R. In fact, the selection can be daunting. I will not provide a comprehensive list, but instead give you my thoughts on each that I have tried.

### 2.1 Websites

[r-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/) is the first place you should go. There is an R learning path which I refer to often. 

[Data Science Central](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/) for me is more of an inspirational site, with some good articles about Data Science in general.

Get all the [cheatsheets from R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).

### 2.2 Video Courses

Instructional videos, but with no teacher-student interaction.

Udemy
Lynda
YouTube Brandon Foltz
Khan Academy

### 2.3 MOOCs

A course with some kind of assessment.

JHU


### 2.4 Interactive

In my opinion, the best way to learn.

[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
Swirl

# 3. Books

I find books to be an essential part of my diet of learning. There is simply nothing better than being able to flick through a non-fiction book.

### 3.1 About R 

Advanced R
Data Science With R

# 4. Community and Events

Living in London, I am lucky to have access to a community of people with a similar interest in R. 

### 4.1 Meetups

[Central London Data Science Project Nights](https://www.meetup.com/central_london_data_science/)  
[LondonR](https://www.meetup.com/LondonR/)

### 4.2 Lectures

### 4.3 Events

Earl Conference

#  5. Projects

I find the best way to learn is by doing. I will put some projects on GitHub.

# 6. Tips and Tricks

Here I share bits and pieces of code, packages, and approaches that helped me. My 'a-ha' moments.

# 7. TLDR

Learning R is a worthwhile thing to do. It's tough, but rewarding. Do it!
